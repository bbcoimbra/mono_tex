This work aims as main objective to describe the implementation of a compiler
that can generate a graphical representation of program logic. Precisely,
this compiler generates two program-objects: one in C language that can be
compiled with a standard C compiler and another in DOT language when compiled
build a graphical representation of program logic. Is hoped this graphical
representation could be a tool that help people to learn programming, because
it shows, explicitly, the execution program flow for novices in this knowledge
branch.
