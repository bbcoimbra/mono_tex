This work aims to show the process of implementation of a compiler.
Are showed modules of compiler and as final result we have two
representations, semantically equivalent, one in C language that can
be compiled with a C compiler and executed, another in DOT language
that when compiled make a graphical representation of source program.
Also are shown tools that supports the compiler implementations,
as well additional data structures that are needed by the compiler
process.
